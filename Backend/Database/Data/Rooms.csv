ScrapHeaps|Scrap-Heap|The smell of rust greets you the instant you enter. A cloud of red dust fills your vision, casting a veil over the chaotic landscape before you.<br /><br />Despite the stinging in your eyes, you can make out mountains of rubbish. Piles of discarded weapons, broken armor and malfunctioning equipment.<br /><br />You step forward, sinking up to your knees in the trash that covers the floor in a thick layer.<br /><br />You resolve yourself to step carefully. The piles shift unpredictably and every now and then, portions of the trash seem to melt through the floor.<br /><br />As you walk deeper into the scrap heap, you wonder. Perhaps you could find something among the garbage that still functions?<br /><br />Even the Star-Tombs' waste was worth a fortune, after all.|ScrapHeap|1|2|2|2|Blindness
WasteTanks|Waste Reclamation|A repugnant smell hits you the moment you step inside, followed by a sharp yellow glare that stabs at your eyes. You stand on a walkway of black metal - like everything else in this place, the material is one you don't recognize.<br /><br />Below, colossal tanks churn with rancid yellow liquid. Their surfaces bubble and seethe angrily. The steam rising from the tanks burns your nose and makes your eyes water.<br /><br />Refuse of various kinds drops randomly into the tanks. There are no pipes, chutes or other means of transportation, the waste seems to ooze out of the reflective ceiling, dropping heavily into the slurry.<br /><br />The sickly glow from the liquid casts long, shuddering shadows across the walls. Yet the light never seems to reach far. Despite the many sources, the room remains drowned in darkness.<br /><br />Ahead, you can vaguely spot the walkway splitting off into a maze of platforms suspended above the tanks. Wanting to get away from the repulsive smell that permeates this place, you get moving.<br /><br />As you walk into the darkness, you wonder what purpose this place once served... And what you might find here.|WasteReclamation|1|3|5|5|None
BrokenReality|Shattered Halls|It is easy to forget, amidst the impossible technology and alien sights, that this place is old. Older than your species, older than life on your planet, possibly even older than the star your home world orbits.<br /><br />It seems even this place of infinite possibilities cannot hold against the ravages of time forever.<br /><br />The room is in shambles. Whatever purpose it might have once served is lost in the chaos of collapsed floors, broken machinery and streams of glowing liquid that seep from cracks in the walls. The lights flicker irregularly, sending out pulses of randomly-colored light that make your stomach churn. <br /><br />Even reality itself seems to be falling apart here, as rubble glitches and stretches unpredictably, like a faulty holo-vision. Some areas are impossible to focus on, lost in a storm of glitching lights and shapes that twist against the laws of geometry.<br /><br />The floor is unsteady as you step further inside. The material, usually solid and indestructible, is soft and malleable like putty beneath your feet. You see a path leading to the other end, but it moves uncomfortably close to the strange phenomenon.<br /><br />Seeing no other way forward, you brace yourself and tread carefully.<br /><br />|ShatteredHalls|1|1|5|10|None
RuinedLife|Decayed Pods|The sight that greets you when you enter the room is ghastly, even for this place. Rows and rows of cylindrical pods stretch through the room. Lines of glitching light across the dark ceiling cast an uncanny, artificial glow over this horrific place.<br /><br />Many of the pods are cracked and broken, spilling rotten, light-blue liquid across the floor. But that isn't all.<br /><br />From several of the pods, malformed heaps of twitching, greyish flesh emerge. Life, in the most pitiful and horrific sense of the word.<br /><br />The lumps are alive, if the twitching eyes and groaning mouths is any indication, but how is anyone's guess? Something must be keeping them alive � some form of life-support built directly into the wretched things. No way something this misshapen could survive otherwise. Yet a cursory glance reveals nothing obvious.<br /><br />In this place, it is always difficult to tell where life ends and technology begins, or vice versa.<br /><br />You step forward cautiously. Most of these things appear incapable of proper motion, but you cannot be certain if that is true for all of them.|DecayedPods|1|3|5|5|None
IndustrialFurnace|Industrial Complex|A wave of heat washes over you the moment you step through the door, making your skin sting and your eyes water. Shielding yourself as best you can, you take in the sight.<br /><br />Unlike most locations you have seen since entering this place, the purpose of this room is clear at a glance.<br /><br />Massive industrial machines work tirelessly, sending out pulses of heat with every action. Pipes of glowing light transport materials between machines. The machines themselves are incomprehensible to you, even if they seem perfectly suited to their purposes.<br /><br />From raw materials, ready to be processed, to finished products, poised for relocation to wherever they are meant to go.<br /><br />It is clear, however, that this place was not built for humans. Every step is a gamble, each moment spent timing the colossal machines carefully to avoid being crushed or blasted to dust by thermal vents.<br /><br />In the distance, you hear movement that feels distinctly different from the towering constructors. Something alive moves among the machines. You are not alone.|IndustrialComplex|2|4|5|5|None
