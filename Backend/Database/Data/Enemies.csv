RogueTimeline|Rogue Timeline|An uncanny sight stands before you. A familiar form, with your own height and width. Every limb, every feature, every twitch of muscle is yours�or should be. Your own face stares back, eyes unreadable.<br /><br />Then something changes.<br /><br />This strange sight, this other you, narrows their eyes in a hateful glare. They step forward, the motion filled with hostility.<br /><br />They move their mouth, speaking in a language that does not exist. You don't know what they're saying, but every word is laced with accusation. As if cursing you for crimes you have never committed.<br /><br />Despite the hatred in their eyes, there is something else. Something desperate, longing and covetous. They do not merely seek to kill you, but to steal your place in this timeline, to live the life denied them by the infinite stream of causality.<br /><br />They raise their weapon in a silent challenge.|Anomaly|5|3|1|PlasmaRifle|PlasmaShot
MechanicalAbomination|Mechanical Abomination|Lumbering footsteps echo through the air, coupled with a sharp scraping. A massive figure looms over you, its single, glowing red orb fixated on you with malevolent focus.<br /><br />The body is an insult against life.<br /><br />Jagged edges and sharp corners blend seamlessly into smooth, almost organic lines. The nightmarish figure moves with a grace no machine should ever possess.<br /><br />The translucent metal roils and shifts like real muscle with every motion the abomination makes as it stalks closer, every step measured by a mind far beyond any human's.<br /><br />Claws of collapsed space-time slice through the indestructible floor like butter as it flexes. A maw, filled to the brim with atom-thin fangs and dripping with acidic fluids, opens in a snarl. For all that you know it is naught but a machine, it looks like the maw of a true predator. One that has finally encountered prey after untold years without.<br /><br />The metallic monstrosity prepares to lunge.|Robot|5|5|1|SpaceTimeClaws|RendingSwipe
FutureGhost|Ghosts of the Future|The shadows move unexpectedly, seething and thrashing like the sea in a storm. As one, the shadows peel off the floor and walls, twisting together in an incomprehensible dance.<br /><br />After a few seconds, that might as well have been centuries, the shadows coalesced into ghostly figures. Living darkness, warped and twisted into a grotesque facsimile of life.<br /><br />The only features that make sense to your mind are the eyes�pools of glowing white, staring at you with something between hatred and curiosity.<br /><br />Whispers reach your ears, speaking of events that cannot be real. The extinction of humanity millions of years from now, the darkening of the stars and the final moments of agony before entropy claims the universe.<br /><br />The temperature drops as the shadows draw closer. Their eyes stare at you with a mix of hatred and pity. You wonder if their hatred is truly for you, or for whatever trapped in this state.<br /><br />The ghostly shades circle closer, their glowing eyes never leaving you.|CosmicHorror|3|1|5|GhostlyWhisper|MindAttack

StarCreature|Miniature Star|A ball of flaming light, barely a hand's width across.<br/>Its light burns your eyes, and you feel its malice somehow portrayed through its featureless landscape of roiling plasma.<br/>It hates you. It <i class='emphBold'>hates</i> what you are. But it adores your presence here, for your deliciously singeable skin is within reach of its mass of millions-of-degrees hot tendrils of hydrogen.|Cosmic|2|1|1|CME|None
Drone|Drones|A swarm of robotic drones, perhaps originally intended for repair jobs; now outfitted with firearms and each covered in scrapes and burns.|Robot|10|2|3|Laser|none
Arm|Robotic Arm|An advanced prosthetic limb, severed and taken over by a lump of pulsing flesh. You think it shouldn't be able to see, but it lunges at you; <i class='emphItalic'>and it is surprisingly agile.</i>|Robot|4|0|0|Arm|none
Soldiers|Soldiers|Previous explorers, or a creation of the <i class='emphRed'>Star Tomb</i> itself.<br/>They bark something as you round the corner; no language you know of. There is a glow in their eyes.<br/>They are not themselves.<br/>They raise their weapons.|Humanoid|6|3|4|Laser|none
